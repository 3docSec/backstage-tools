## Introduction

With `c4-review` you can:
- see a summary of the findings with duplicate counts and a list of handles that found each issue
- estimate your contest payout given the current status of the GitHub finding repo.

Just find out the findings repo name of the contest you look for and try out one of the commands below.

For even prettier output just pipe the command into the `jq` tool.

e.g.

```
$ ./c4-review payouts 2023-08-goodentry-findings 46000 | jq
```
